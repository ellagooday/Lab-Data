3781,37776825,2015-07-10,36059247,Greg,The apartment was as advertised and Frank was incredibly helpful through the entire process. I would definitely recommend this place.
3781,41842494,2015-08-09,10459388,Tai,"It was a pleasure to stay at Frank's place. The place has everything you need to make it a home base to visit or work downtown.  It is close to Maverick square which is 5 min train ride to downtown Boston.  Parking is a breeze here if you drive in, lot of street parking plus a private spot.  Frank give you a lot of privacy and very knowledgeable about the area.  I would stay here again next time I am in Boston."
3781,45282151,2015-09-01,12264652,Damien,"The apartment description is entirely faithful, and the building very well maintained. A/C, laundry and other utilities are all very convenient. There is a nice view of the harbor from the back of the building, which lends itself well for a quiet, relaxing evening. Frank was very helpful throughout the duration of the stay. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat."
3781,49022647,2015-09-30,41426327,Mike,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time at Frank's home. Had all amenities, was very clean and accommodating. I was very happy with the location and having private lock and gate parking. Lots of great food in the neighborhood and a fantastic view of the seaport. Theres a good chance I will be back in Boston next year for work and will definitely be looking to stay here again!"
3781,52503327,2015-10-30,15151513,Ivan,"Great value for the money! This location has exceeding my expectations. <br/><br/>1. Photos don't do justice to the place. It's very cozy and homely. <br/><br/>2. The location is very convenient. It's a five minute walk to the airport (so you really don't have to hire a cab to get to the house if you're coming by plane). You can take the Silver Line bus from the airport, which takes you to South Station, with a stop at the Convention Center. The ride to the city is free ! Those buses take off every 6-10 minutes or so. <br/><br/>3. Despite being close to the airport, the house is very calm, and I didn't have any trouble sleeping -- and I'm *VERY* sensitive to noise, so it means that the place is indeed very calm. <br/><br/><br/>4. Responsive but not overbearing host. A pleasure dealing with."
3781,63371931,2016-02-22,55456499,John-Mark,"Frank was very accommodating throughout my stay in East Boston. He is easy to reach via text, phone, or email. Frank provided detailed instructions for entry allowing for a seamless transition from airport to residence. <br/><br/>Upon entry it is clear that Frank takes pride in a clean and presentable home. If you're in need of a home away from home whether for business or leisure this is your spot! <br/>"
3781,67909504,2016-04-01,55456499,John-Mark,Excellent! This was my second stay at the Jeffries St location and once again Frank was an extraordinarily helpful and accommodating host. If business brings me back to the East Boston area I will not hesitate reaching out for a third stay. 
3781,97906006,2016-08-28,88528884,Elisa,"Frank was a wonderful and accommodating host. He was responsive to any questions I had. The place is exactly as described and pictured. It was very clean and orderly. When I arrived, the check in process was smooth and easy. The place is ideally located close to the Harbor Walk and a short walk away from water taxis and other public transport into downtown Boston. My three night stay was enhanced by the well equipped kitchen and restaurants in walking distance. It was perfect for my weekend in Boston!"
3781,105143774,2016-09-30,1342806,Nicole,"Frank was great, the apartment has everything we need, including parking and the neighborhood is lovely!  So close to the water, restaurants, train and the airport (8 min walk!)"
3781,129692749,2017-02-01,55126634,Carlos,Very nice. Comfortable apartment. Good location. Frank is very nice person. 
3781,155725362,2017-05-28,117390053,Carolyn,"Apartment was everything described. Very clean and within walking distance from the airport. Had to get on a bus to take you to the subway, which was ""sketchy"" at night. Other than that is was good. "
3781,184356065,2017-08-19,70187382,Justin,"Frank's place is in a great part of East Boston.  The location is nice and quiet (the airport noise isn't really that bad here), but it's pretty close to the blue line which makes it an easy hop into the city.  There are great jogging trails nearby and the Pier Park around the corner is beautiful.  It's not a super fancy apartment but everything is in working order and it's a comfortable place to stay.  I also think you get good value for your money here since East Boston is still considerably cheaper than most of the rest of the city.  Overall, I recommend the place!"
3781,194026175,2017-09-15,11888800,John,"Franks' place is the ground floor unit in a 3 storey wooden multi-family house, with Frank living upstairs.  The apartment is comfortable and was ideal for my 4 week stay with great cooking facilities and more spacious than a studio.  It's a few yards to the harbourside, and a 15 minute walk to the airport.  The nearest Metro station is about a mile away but then its just 1 stop to Boston city.  East Boston is a blue-collar area that is up-and-coming due to its convenience and harbour views but don't expect much in the way of trendy cafe's or restaurants.  The ones there are are typically Italian or Latino and cater to the locals rather than tourists.  There is KO Pies nearby, run by a bunch of Aussies keen to educate New Englanders on the delights of the aussie meat pie, and well worth a visit.  There are great parks nearby and excellent jogging routes.  Franks place would suit a couple but not a family as there's just one double bed.  In terms of value for money, Franks is unbeatable and is a great place to base yourself for a Boston visit or a long-term stay."

3781,415389126,2019-02-22,83031353,Norman,My partner and I stayed at Frank's apartment for several months and it was a great experience! Frank is accommodating and thoughtful in our needs while also giving us a good amount of privacy. Location is great as it's in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Would  definitely stay here if I have to be in this area in the future!<br/>Thanks!
3781,579765013,2019-12-21,3918963,Antoine,I liked very much this apartment rented by Frank. The place was perfectly clean with every think that I needed for a middle-long stay in Boston.  Frank is a great host that is very responsive and made everything to facilitate my stay. I liked also very much the neighborhood with the piers literally at the end of the street and the nice Piers park at 5 min walk. I'd highly recommend it to everyone!
3781,659896032,2020-09-03,344701185,Ugur,"I stayed at Frank's apartment for three months and my stay was excellent! The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, the apartment was just as described, very orderly and clean, and it comes with all the amenities you need. Perfect for a long stay in Boston."
3781,716793055,2020-12-20,348888007,Josiah,"Wonderful 1 bedroom with a great location! The apartment amenities were perfect for a long-term stay and its proximity to many parks provided wonderful views of Boston and the harbor. The walkable location made it easy to reach many businesses on foot, and the private driveway made parking and commuting outisde of Boston a breeze. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here!"
3781,734556136,2021-02-26,345613836,Justin,Great place - amazing location.   Highly recommend.
3781,753337824,2021-04-30,60267441,Alison,"This apartment is perfect for short or long term stays. It's cozy and has everything you could need. I especially loved the location, being able to walk along the harbor and bike up to the beaches."
3781,4.14455E+17,2021-07-25,387513970,Ana,"I stayed at this apartment for three months and it was perfect. Short walk to public transportation, a lot of nice parks nearby, and the apartment itself was exactly as described. The kitchen is well-equipped and there was a desk provided which made working from home easy. Frank is also easily reachable by phone and was quick to respond if I needed help or had any sort of questions. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend to others."
5506,1021,2009-03-21,8903,Jenny,Terry's Hotel Alterntv in Boston was a perfect place to stay for myself and my partner.  We mixed our trip with business and pleasure and found the room perfectly appointed for our needs and affordable.  A great stay!
5506,1953,2009-05-01,12970,Clint,Warm and accommodating host. Beautiful and well appointed room.
5506,10089,2009-09-14,14033,Nicolas,"We stay 3 nights at the Hotel Alternative and have complete confort, sweet bed and a very nice welcome.<br/>Close to the metro, here is the ideal place for a discovering trip town!!!"
5506,18678,2009-11-29,51993,Sarah,"We stayed in the private room.  Terry provided a mini fridge and microwave, bath products, guidebooks, soft sheets and fluffy towels.  We were very cozy despite it being a blustery winter weekend.  Downtown Boston was visible from our room on the 3rd floor and, though the T was nearby, we enjoyed walking into town.  What a good value-- we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.   "
5506,24467,2010-01-19,68674,LaJuan,Stayed here recently during a conference and the accomodations were fantastic!  Terry is very laid back  and very hospitable.  The location is great.  I used mass transit most of the time and the conference sites I visited were very accessible.  I would highly recommend this experience as an alternative to an overpriced hotel.  
5506,25958,2010-02-13,47993,Juan Carlos,"My partner and I stayed for a week at Terry's during our vacation and it was a great experience.  We were happy with our decision to stay there.  The space is comfortable; we were able to relax.  The room is very close to the train, so it was easy to hop on the train and get around Boston and come back to our room whenever we wanted.  We felt welcomed, safe, and comfortable.  I would recommend it without hesitations."
5506,26888,2010-02-19,68528,Deborah,"Terry is welcoming and helpful.  The condo was lovely - thoroughly applianced kitchen, gorgeous bathroom,  comfortable lounge and cosy bed. I felt very at home and it was easy to get in to Boston, with loads of useful information, mpas, books etc.  The only small niggle is that the staircase to the bedroom was a surprise! but otherwise thank you for a wonderful warm stay"
5506,28570,2010-03-07,41492,Tiffany,"I stayed at Terry's for 3 nights. The guest room was great! Very clean, and everything as promised was there. Terry's attention to detail and small details were much appreciated. Much better value compared to a hotel! Would definitely stay there again :-) "
